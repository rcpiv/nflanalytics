## This is where I store my nfl analytic musings
### Background
Hi, I am Robby Patterson: avid football and data fan. This repository serves as place to store all of my little projects I put together regarding NFL data. If I ever put together a larger project, it will probably live in its owen repo. Not sure how I want to structure this README yet but wanted to get something started!
